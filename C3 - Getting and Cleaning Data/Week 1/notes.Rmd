- Databases
- APIs

Data formats

- Flat files
- XML
- JSON

Making data tidy (principles and how to)
Distributing data
Scripting for data cleaning

RAW DATA > Processing script > TIDY DATA > data analysis > data communication

# 2. RAW DATA

Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set of items.

Data is raw when:

- No software ran on data
- No manipulation on data
- No data removed
- No data summarized

Qualitative: Country, sex, treatment

Raw data

- Original source of data
- Difficult to use

Processed Data

- Ready for analysis
- Standards for processing

# 3. TIDY DATA

What you need?

- The raw data
- A tidy data set
- Code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set
- An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 -> 2,3

Data is tidy when:

- Each variable you measure should be in one column
- Each observation os variable should be in a different row
- The should be one table for each kind of variable
- Links between tables on columns (keys)

Reccomendations:

- One file per table
- First row with variable names
- Variable names readable

# 3.1 CODE BOOK

- Information about variables (code book)
- Information about summary choices made
- Information about experimental study design (how you collected data)
- Normally word/text file

# 3.2 INSTRUCTION LIST
